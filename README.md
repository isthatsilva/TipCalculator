## Description

This application is a tip calculator app designed specifically for restaurants to streamline tip distribution and record-keeping. It guides the user through a simple, step-by-step process to collect and calculate tips for each shift. First, the app asks how many servers worked during the lunch and dinner shifts. It then prompts the user to enter the total lunch tips, followed by the total tips at the close of day. Using this information, the app automatically calculates the dinner tips by subtracting the lunch tips from the total daily tips. The lunch and dinner tips are then evenly divided among the respective shift's servers. The application employs a sequential question flow, where each question appears individually and replaces the previous one, creating a focused and user-friendly experience. Once all data has been collected, the app presents a final summary that includes total lunch tips, total dinner tips, and the per-server tip amounts for both shifts.
